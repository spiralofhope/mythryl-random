These are the files from the

    Multi-file Projects: Compiling a Stand-Alone Executable

tutorial from http://mythryl.org.

If you have Mythryl installed on your system you may compile
the "factor" executable image described in the tutorial by
doing

    build-an-executable-mythryl-heap-image factor.lib main::main

in this directory, after which you should be able to do:

    linux$ ./factor 23 24
    23: 23
    24: 2 2 2 3

    linux$
